# Goosfraba Test App

A small app that fetches a list of posts from a GraphQL API and displays a chart representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019.

# Installation and Setup Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone down the repository. You will need **node** and **npm** installed globally on your machine.

Installation:

### npm install

After the dependencies are installed you must run:

### **npm start**

And then go to *http://localhost:3000*

## Technologies used:

- **GraphQL** - for data query and manipulation
- **Apollo Client** - for managing the data from GraphQL
- **Chart.js** - for the data visualization



This is a simple app that I had to finish for Goosfraba after the interview I had with them.

At first I tried to write this project in JavaScript and use the chart from Airbnb, namely visx butt because this was the first time I was working with a chart in Javascript, visx seemed a bit difficult so I decided to use chart.js. Along the way I encountered some problems that made me start a new project in TypeScript.

The problems where based on the syntax, because I could not use the syntax I needed to  write the chart in JavaScript, only in TypeScript 



## Steps taken

I started cleaning up the project deleting all the unnecessary components and lines of code.

- setupTests.ts
